# Dialogue with Jean
TALK§Stranger§Oh, you’re open. I thought this bakery was getting closed yesterday. 
TALK§You§It’s Christmas Eve. It didn’t feel right to leave the townspeople without their cakes and muffins today.
TALK§Stranger§Celebrating Christmas is such a stupid idea. So much time wasted that could’ve been spent building successful businesses.
#TALK§Stranger§Anyway, my name’s Jean. I work for Fishy Business Inc., the corporation that is going to pay your debt.
#TALK§You§You mean, the company that is going to buy my shop
#TALK§Jean§Well, honey, small businesses never last long. 20% of them fail during the first two years. 45% don’t even last five. And 65% close in the first 10.
#TALK§Jean§The fiasco of your bakery was just a matter of time. You’re incredibly lucky that we are willing to pay you for it. And you’re also welcome.
#TALK§You§I know I have a big debt, but I could’ve payed it with a little more time!
#TALK§Jean§Could you? Let’s see. You called your business ‘Bubble Bakery’ because you serve some kind of bubble icing. Come on, anyone can make bubbles, why are yours so special?
#TALK§You§Well, they-
#TALK§Jean§Bubbles as a theme is, uh… un unwise business plan, I’d say.
#TALK§Jean§But don’t feel bad, not everyone is creative enough for these things.
#TALK§You§And what is it that you’ll build here that is such a good business plan?
#TALK§Jean§A new Burgerfins! The fast-food chain with 49 restaurants all across the seven seas that is making billions of sandollars.
#TALK§Jean§People love it because they don’t have to ask where the fish we serve come from. And everyone is tired of all that ‘eco-friendly’, ‘buy local’ headache.
#TALK§Jean§Burgerfins! Don’t eat moral, eat fast.
#TALK§You§Ah, so my bakery is being turned into a predatory business. That’s great.
#TALK§Jean§That’s what happens when you’re last in the food chain, honey. And I guess you could say that I am a finance shark. Ha!
#TALK§You§…
#TALK§You§Do you want a bubble muffin before you leave?
#TALK§Jean§Of course not. You somehow manage to turn the salty water around this bakery into sugary one. It’s incredible. And also revolting.
#TALK§Jean§I’ll be on my way now. You’ll receive the payment from Fishy Business Inc. tonight. I hope you invest it in a… better way this time.

# Dialogue with Coral
TALK§Coral§Oh my gosh you are open! You just saved my day!
TALK§You§Hi Coral. How are you?
TALK§Coral§Ahh… I am totally exhausted. I really need a sugar rush right now!
TALK§You§What have you been up to?
TALK§Coral§Oh, just some early morning pirate-hunting. Those guys fought reaaaaally hard not to get drowned and torn into pieces!
TALK§You§No wonder you’re drained. May I suggest a ‘Life buoy donut’? They are the perfect fit to get a quick energy boost.
TALK§Coral§Oh, yes please! I love how you decorate them. Giggles. They remind me of my times chasing down cruise ships.
# bake the donut
TALK§You§Here you go, a freshly baked ‘Life buoy donut’.
TALK§Coral§You are my saviour! My people disapprove of my love for chocolate and glace icing, you know.
TALK§Coral§They don’t understand eating if you haven’t lured your food into a horrible death first. Sighs
TALK§You§Yeah, you’re the only merepeople customer I have.
TALK§Coral§Right? I like having sweet things from time to time. Drinking earthlings’ blood and devouring their flesh can get boring sometimes.
TALK§You§Totally understandable.
TALK§Coral§Anyway, thank you for the donut! And have a happy Christmas!
TALK§You§You too, Coral!
