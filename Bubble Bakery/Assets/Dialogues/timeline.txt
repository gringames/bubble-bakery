#ENTER-cthullu
TALK-Stranger-Oh, you’re open. I thought this bakery was getting closed yesterday. 
TALK-You-It’s Christmas Eve. It didn’t feel right to leave the townspeople without their cakes and muffins today.
TALK-Stranger-Celebrating Christmas is such a stupid idea. So much time wasted that could’ve been spent building successful businesses.
TALK-Stranger-Anyway, my name’s Jean. I work for Fishy Business Inc., the corporation that is going to pay your debt.
TALK-You-You mean, the company that is going to buy my shop
