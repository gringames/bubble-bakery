# Dialogue with Jean
TALK§Stranger§Oh, you’re open. I thought this bakery was getting closed yesterday. 
TALK§You§It’s Christmas Eve. It didn’t feel right to leave the townspeople without their cakes and muffins today.
TALK§Stranger§Celebrating Christmas is such a stupid idea. So much time wasted that could’ve been spent building successful businesses.
TALK§Stranger§Anyway, my name’s Jean. I work for Fishy Business Inc., the corporation that is going to pay your debt.
TALK§You§You mean, the company that is going to buy my shop
TALK§Jean§Well, honey, small businesses never last long. 20% of them fail during the first two years. 45% don’t even last five. And 65% close in the first 10.
TALK§Jean§The fiasco of your bakery was just a matter of time. You’re incredibly lucky that we are willing to pay you for it. And you’re also welcome.
TALK§You§I know I have a big debt, but I could’ve payed it with a little more time!
TALK§Jean§Could you? Let’s see. You called your business ‘Bubble Bakery’ because you serve some kind of bubble icing.
TALK§Jean§Come on, anyone can make bubbles, why are yours so special?
TALK§You§Well, they-
TALK§Jean§Bubbles as a theme is, uh… un unwise business plan, I’d say.
TALK§Jean§But don’t feel bad, not everyone is creative enough for these things.
TALK§You§And what is it that you’ll build here that is such a good business plan?
TALK§Jean§A new Burgerfins! The fast-food chain with 49 restaurants all across the seven seas that is making billions of sandollars.
TALK§Jean§People love it because they don’t have to ask where the fish we serve come from. And everyone is tired of all that ‘eco-friendly’, ‘buy local’ headache.
TALK§Jean§Burgerfins! Don’t eat moral, eat fast.
TALK§You§Ah, so my bakery is being turned into a predatory business. That’s great.
TALK§Jean§That’s what happens when you’re last in the food chain, honey. And I guess you could say that I am a finance shark. Ha!
TALK§You§…
TALK§You§Do you want a bubble muffin before you leave?
TALK§Jean§Of course not. You somehow manage to turn the salty water around this bakery into sugary one. It’s incredible. And also revolting.
TALK§Jean§I’ll be on my way now. You’ll receive the payment from Fishy Business Inc. tonight. I hope you invest it in a… better way this time.

# Dialogue with Coral
TALK§Coral§Oh my gosh you are open! You just saved my day!
TALK§You§Hi Coral. How are you?
TALK§Coral§Ahh… I am totally exhausted. I really need a sugar rush right now!
TALK§You§What have you been up to?
TALK§Coral§Oh, just some early morning pirate-hunting. Those guys fought reaaaaally hard not to get drowned and torn into pieces!
TALK§You§No wonder you’re drained. May I suggest a ‘Life buoy donut’? They are the perfect fit to get a quick energy boost.
TALK§Coral§Oh, yes please! I love how you decorate them. Giggles. They remind me of my times chasing down cruise ships.
# bake the donut
TALK§You§Here you go, a freshly baked ‘Life buoy donut’.
TALK§Coral§You are my saviour! My people disapprove of my love for chocolate and glace icing, you know.
TALK§Coral§They don’t understand eating if you haven’t lured your food into a horrible death first. Sighs
TALK§You§Yeah, you’re the only merepeople customer I have.
TALK§Coral§Right? I like having sweet things from time to time. Drinking earthlings’ blood and devouring their flesh can get boring sometimes.
TALK§You§Totally understandable.
TALK§Coral§Anyway, thank you for the donut! And have a happy Christmas!
TALK§You§You too, Coral!

TALK§You§Em, er… Just give me one second, please.
TALK§You§(Ok, Ok. Relax. Acting scared may be diserspectful.)
TALK§You§(Luckily, one of the reasons I have a huge debt is because I bought a cryptid translator to be diversity-friendly!)
TALK§Cthullu§Ya hai kadishtu ep r’luh-eeh Nyogtha eeh, s’uhn-ngh athg li’hee arr’e syha’h.
TALK§You§Where did I put it…? Oh, yeah, here! Beep Ok! I can understand you now!
TALK§Cthullu§Oh, good mornin’. I was just commentin’ how nice yer bakery looks. The sugar taste in the water is delightful, too.
TALK§You§You were? I mean, thank you so much, sir. I thought your kind disliked glucose.
TALK§Cthullu§I didn’ use to eat cookies when I was workin’. I left my job, though. I got tired of imaginin’ new nightmares for the earthlings.
TALK§Cthullu§Ye won’t believe the crazy ideas those earthlanders come up with on their own. ‘Twas hard to keep it up, ye know?
TALK§You§It had to be difficult.
TALK§Cthullu§Yeah. And I didn’t even like it. So I left tryin’ to find a cultist prone to announce my comin’ and decided to become a dad!
TALK§You§A… dad?

# dialogue (again first line missing somehow)
TALK§Don§Ho-oh-oh. 
TALK§Don§Ho-oh-oh. 
TALK§Don§Sorry, that wasn’t a Santawalrus impression, I was just coughing.
TALK§You§Hello, Don. Enjoying Christmas?
TALK§Don§Nah, I don’t really like festivities. Adults shouldn’t care too much for these things.
TALK§You§And why is that? I think there is some magic in celebrating these events.
TALK§Don§It just… doesn’t feel the same.
TALK§You§Yet you’re dressing up as Santawalrus.
TALK§Don§That’s because they pay well. And because of the kids. They love these stupid activities.
TALK§Don§I remember when I was a youngling who believed in Santawalrus. I miss having that blind faith in the world.
TALK§You§You can still have it as an adult.
TALK§Don§How can you say that when they are forcing you to close the bakery?
TALK§You§... You may be right.
TALK§Don§Sorry, I didn’t mean to be rude.
TALK§Don§But you have no idea of how much these bubbles tickle. They make me be more ill-mannered than usual.
TALK§You§Ha, ha, ha, right. Don’t worry. Are you here to grab your daily salty coffee?
TALK§Don§I actually came to order a batch of cookies. I want to give them away in the town square.
TALK§You§Aw, you do have a sweet heart under your grumpy façade!
TALK§Don§When you say it like that it sounds awful.
TALK§You§No, it doesn’t! Give me a moment and I’ll have your cookies ready.

# The player bakes the cookies.

TALK§You§Do you think these will be enough?
TALK§Don§You made a lot of them, yes. Thank you.
TALK§You§You’re welcome! And, by the way, they are free.
TALK§Don§Don’t be stupid. You need the money.
TALK§You§Nah, not anymore. Some company shark is giving me tons of it tonight. I’ll be fine.
TALK§You§But, hey, Don, I kind of need something to cheer myself up today. Do you mind if I accompany you to give those cookies away?
TALK§Don§I will be very happy to have you in. Are you sure you’re fine?
TALK§You§I am. I just need to feel the Christmas joy a little bit.
TALK§Don§Alright. Let’s take the cookies to the town square, then.
