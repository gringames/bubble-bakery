TALK§You§Here you have!
TALK§Coral§Oooh I like the ones that look like tiny fish!

TALK§You§(Oops, I left the translator in the bakery.) 
TALK§Don§Who wants to taste these delicious cookies? The baker made them for all of us!
TALK§Townie§They are as appetizing as always, baker.
TALK§You§I’m so glad you enjoy them.
TALK§Coral§Yeah, I was so sad when I heard you had to close the bakery.
TALK§Townie§It would be sad… if it really had to close.
TALK§You§Ha, ha, yeah. Sorry for bringing this up to you guys, but Fishy Business Inc. has bought the bakery.
TALK§Townie§No, they haven’t. Someone paid your debt first.
TALK§You§Wait, what!?
TALK§Cthulhu§Y’ai ng’ngah, Yog-Sothoth h’ee- I’greb f’ai throdog uaaah.
TALK§Townie§Cithulei is right. We didn’t want the bakery to be turned into some crappy fast food restaurant. So the town raised the money and paid for it.
TALK§You§You… you guys did that for me?
TALK§Seahorses§We want to have cookies everyday!
TALK§Coral§I would totally die without your bubble icing!

TALK§Don§I guess magic does exist, after all.
TALK§You§Don...
TALK§Don§Happy Christmas, baker.
